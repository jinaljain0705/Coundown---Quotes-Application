# 💻 Project: Countdown & Quotes Application

 📝 Project Definition

💡 Objective:

 To create a JavaScript-based interactive application that shows a real-time countdown timer to a specific event, an automatic quotes slider, and a modal popup that appears after a delay. The app will use arrays, loops, functions, ES6 features, DOM manipulation, setTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval to provide a dynamic user experience.

🧩 Project Flow

⏳ Countdown Timer

1. Start a countdown timer to a future event (e.g., New Year, Exam Date).
2. Use setInterval() to update the timer every second.
3. When the timer reaches zero, stop using clearInterval() and display: “Time’s up! The event has started 🎉”.
   
💬 Quotes Slider

1. Store 5–6 motivational quotes in an array.
2. Use a loop to switch between quotes automatically every 3–5 seconds using setInterval().
3. Quotes are displayed dynamically on the webpage.
   
🖼️ Modal Popup

1. After 5 seconds of page load, show a modal window using setTimeout().
2. The modal contains a welcome message or event information.
3. Users can close the modal using a close button.
   
🎯 User Interactions

1. Buttons for Start/Pause Countdown (toggle between setInterval() and clearInterval()).
2. Manual Next/Previous buttons for quotes in addition to automatic sliding.
   
✅ Final Output

* Countdown Timer displayed on the webpage.
* Motivational quotes changing automatically.
* Modal popup with event/welcome message.

💡 Example Output:

* Countdown to New Year 🎉:
 10 Days 05 Hours 20 Minutes 45 Seconds
  
* Quote Slider:
 "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."

* Modal (after 5 seconds):
 "Welcome to Countdown & Quotes App 🚀 — Stay motivated!"

📚 JavaScript Concepts Covered:
1. Arrays (storing quotes)
2. Loops (iterating through quotes)
3. Functions (countdown, slider, modal logic)
4. ES6 Features (let, const, template literals, arrow functions)
5. Conditional Statements (stop timer at zero)
6. DOM Manipulation (rendering timer, quotes, and modal)
7. setTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval
